## Oreum Recruit Project `oreum_recruit_exercises`

## 1. Instructions for Manual Installation of the Environment

This project is intended for interactive development and execution and is
manually installed.

### 1.1 Pre-req: Continuum Anaconda Python 3.9.* 64bit

### 1.3 Create virtual environment

Notes:

+ This compound method uses `conda` for main environment and packages,
and `pip` for selected additional packages handled better by pip than conda.
+ See [cheat sheet of conda commands](https://conda.io/docs/_downloads/conda-cheatsheet.pdf)
+ Use `direnv` on MacOS to automatically run file `.envrc` upon directory open
